Build your FeedBlitz email newsletter subscription list faster with simple checkboxes on user registration and / or comment forms.

== Description ==

Get more WordPress email subscribers with this plugin from FeedBlitz. the goal is to accelerate list growth by placing a "subscribe me" checkbox into two existing user interactions: registering for the site and leaving a comment. 

The plugin does two things:

1. Adds a checkbox to the user registration screen (see screenshots)
1. Adds a similar check box to the comment form (see screenshots)

You can customize the text associated with the check box. When the check box is checked, FeedBlitz will email an top in activation form to the user using the email address given in the relevant form. The user then clicks the link and completes a CAPTCHA in order to join your list. 

Because the opt-in is available during existing user interactions, it is very easy for a user to start the subscription process, accelerating your list's growth.

Dual opt-in, CAPTCHA codes and other techniques are used to minimize any potential risk of abuse. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `feedblitz_membermail.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/feedblitzmembermail` directory.
1. Configure and then activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a FeedBlitz account? =

Yes, you must have an active FeedBlitz account and an active mailing list. The plugin has links to set that up if necessary. A demo video is at http://www.feedblitz.com/help/tour.asp

= Is this plugin dual opt-in? =

If a user is already on the list FeedBlitz will de-duplicate them; they will not be required to opt in again and again.
